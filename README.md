### EH3D-PROJECT-PASSPORT: the technical passport of a project: tools, input and output files with their hashes, checks, limitations and pending decisions. Early code.

**Honesty check - what actually runs today:** a Rust library and a command line that read a passport (a JSON file whose sections are always written, even when empty), find bad hashes, unsafe paths, duplicates and tools without a version, print the SHA-256 of its canonical content, compare it with the files of a folder (which is only read) to find the ones that are missing or changed, compare two passports and print the references of files for writing one. All of it has run only on data made by its own tests. What does not exist: the generator that builds a passport from a project and its history, the signature and the rebuilding of the manufacturing files.

> **Safety and security status:** this repository is at its first steps and is not a safety system. Nothing written here replaces the limits, interlocks and emergency stop of the machine and its controller.

## 🚦 Project status

Each line is one part of this repository and the light says how far it is today. It is written from what the repository can show (tests, builds, runs), not from what is planned.

🟢 Done and verified · 🟡 Works, with known limits · 🟠 Partly done or not verified yet · 🔴 Not done or not working

| Area | State | What it means here |
|---|---|---|
| Repository checks | 🟡 | The repository check, the check of the pictures and the 3 tests of the base run in CI and pass. |
| Tests | 🟡 | 13 tests of the Rust code and the 3 of the base pass on a computer. They use only data made by the tests themselves. |
| Real hardware | 🟠 | Not run on any machine or board: nothing here has been tried on hardware. |
| Planned function | 🟠 | Written: the sections of the passport, the checks, the canonical hash, the comparison with the files of a folder and between two passports. Not written: the generator from a project, the rebuilding of the manufacturing files and the optional signature. |
| Requirements | 🟠 | 5 of the 6 requirements are at prototype; the optional signature (PPAS-005) is only planned. None is validated. |

## 🎯 Overview

* **What exists:** a library and a command line, without a window, that check a passport (`check`), compare it with a folder (`verify`), print its hash (`hash`), compare two passports (`compare`) and hash files (`hashfiles`). **Planned:** the generator from a project, the rebuilding of the manufacturing files, the optional signature and a kind of server task.

## 🧩 Role in EH3D

EH3D-PROJECT-PASSPORT is part of the PHOENIX family of the EH3D Fabrication Suite. What it will do, what it will not do yet, its requirements and its relations with other repositories are written in the `docs/` folder.

## 🏛️ Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/architecture.svg" alt="EH3D-PROJECT-PASSPORT architecture: who uses it, what it holds and what it depends on" width="100%">
</p>

How the parts of this repository fit together: who uses it, what it holds and what it depends on. The picture is drawn from `docs/architecture.json` and checked against the code.

## 🚀 Quick start

You need Python 3.10 or newer; there is nothing to install.

```bash
python -I tools/ci_validate.py
python -I tools/make_architecture.py --check
python -I tools/make_structure.py --check --readmes
python -I -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py"
```

## 🧪 Testing

The base has 3 tests (`python -I -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py"`), and they pass. The CI runs the repository check, the check of the pictures and those tests.

## 🏗️ Build & Release

The version lives in the `VERSION` file and in `eh3d.project.json`, and each version has its entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). There is nothing to build; releases are published on GitHub.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Known limits

**Known limits today**

* Early code: it has only run on data made by its own tests; it does not build a passport from a project and it does not sign.

**Next**

* Wait until the contracts this project depends on are accepted (see `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`), then write the first version with tests and replace the status rows with real results.

## 🌍 Languages

README and texts exist in English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Japanese and European Portuguese.

## 🤝 Contributing & Community

* Before a pull request run `python -I tools/ci_validate.py` and the tests of the base: all must pass. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* The README exists in eight languages: a change to the text is made in all eight files, and the two pictures are drawn from `docs/architecture.json` and `docs/structure.json` by `tools/make_architecture.py` and `tools/make_structure.py`.
* Report a vulnerability privately: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Questions, ideas and reports: electrohobby3d@gmail.com ([SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md)).
